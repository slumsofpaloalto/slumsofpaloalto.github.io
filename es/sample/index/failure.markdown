### Failure: Most Epic

My most epic failure was also my fastest. It took only a minute or
two. And it was twenty five years ago, in 1989. Going back to that
fateful evening…

> Tonight, Rebecca and I are having dinner with our families. It is the night
before we formally walk: tomorrow we get a nice piece of paper for graduating
from Caltech. Graduating from Caltech has not been easy for either of us, so
this is a very significant event. And having most of our family around us is
really nice too. We are incredibly happy.

> Rebecca has a cat named Houdini. She found Houdini as a stray, washed
her up, and out popped a beautiful Norwegian Forest cat. Houdini is
amazingly smart and quite friendly too. Amongst the best cats I have ever had
or seen. Houdini got her name “Harriet Houdini” based on her ability to
escape from closed rooms. During the recent school year, a friend was staying in
a house near Caltech, and Rebecca sometimes kept the cat at that person’s
house. During the day, Houdini would be safely locked in a room with closed
windows and a closed door, but by afternoon she would magically escape and
appear outside the house wandering the yard. This happened many times. The
friend swore he did not let her out. Hence the name.

> But tonight, Houdini is staying in Rebecca’s mother’s condo in Chino,
about forty minutes east of Pasadena. Rebecca has been staying in that condo
for maybe half a year or so, and given Houdini is there, Rebecca has to go back
there to feed her. Most of Rebecca’s clothes are there too, so she needs to go
back to change as well. So after dinner, Rebecca, the love of my life, departs to
Chino.


> An hour or two later I get a call from Rebecca. It is maybe 11PM or
midnight, the night before our graduation. I am a night owl, so I am awake
but I am definitely surprised by the call. Rebecca says something like “Can you
come and get me?” She may also say, “I am in the hospital”, but I am not
sure.  Later in my life, I will know the right answer to this question, but the
two-minute epic failure of my life involves me saying things like “What are you
talking about?”, “You are an hour away”, and “It is graduation night”. The
only right answer is: “Yes, I will be right there!”  Not saying those six simple
words immediately will forever be my life’s crowning failure.

> Rebecca had been assaulted at knifepoint in her Chino condo’s carport.
Whether the person wanted just money or something worse, we will never know.
Rebecca screamed and amazingly grabbed the knife. By the blade! Fortunately
this reaction scared the perpetrator off. A call to 911 and Rebecca was escorted
by police to the hospital.

> She is calling me from there. After having survived a mugging at
knifepoint. Again, my life’s crowning failure. And one I immediately
committed to never even getting close to again. To never fail her again.
We walked and formally graduated the next day. Rebecca’s finger is
bandaged to protect the deep wound and its stitching. We are both very tired,
but very happy.

We have rarely been apart since then. It is twenty five years later.
