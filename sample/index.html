  <h3>Love: Nature</h3>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="/images/Sopa_04_Nature_w12per.png"  alt="Nature">
</div>


<p>Nature has an incredible influence on humans.  Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Bryce, Tahoe, Muir Woods, and many other natural wonders have heavily influenced my family and me.  They are amazing.  You need to see them.  If you have a chance, put this book down right now and make the reservation.  Then pick it back up: you can bring it with you.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Rebecca and I are especially enchanted by Yosemite.  It is awesome, and its awe changes with the seasons, and with the shape of our family.  Rebecca and I went several times when we were young.  We have sat on the top of the fissures staring down several thousand feet at the beautiful valley floor beneath us.  Today, just thinking about it, makes me shudder.  I don’t think at my current age I could sit there and look down.  Too many images of accidentally “taking a leap” fly through my head.</p>

<p>Rebecca and I have also tried to hike up the mist trail to Nevada falls in the winter, but were ultimately repelled by snow and ice.  And one Spring, our whole family caught giant snowflakes that poured down on us in a freakish April snowstorm.  Yosemite is amazing.  And so are all the other national treasures.  Sometimes politicians do the right thing.</p>

<h3>Kindness: Bunnies</h3>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="/images/Sopa_08_Bunny_12per.png"  alt="Bunny">
</div>


<p>&hellip;One morning, when maybe going out to fish, I encountered a bunny.  The bunny had not had a good day.  Apparently it argued with a cat or other predator, and although it (or maybe I) convinced that other animal to go away, the other animal had done some serious damage in the process.  A rear leg was not really attached anymore, and blood was coming from many different parts of the bunny.  But the bunny was alive.  It was incredibly cute.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I picked up the bunny, and held it.  I had never had something so small, cute, and cuddly in my hands before.  I so wanted to keep this incredible source of happiness as my pet.  Too have my own little bunny, which I would take care of and it would make me happy.</p>

<p>But the extent of the injuries made it obvious that this was not to be&hellip;.</p>

<h3>The Slums of Palo Alto <small><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></small></h3>

<p>The putting green on the balcony overlooked the Santa Monica pier. &hellip;  I never heard the elevator pitch , but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.</p>

<p>This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  My story is not the story most people tell.  The media talks about Facebook, Apple, Snapchat, and Google.  Silicon valley is all about success: unicorns are everywhere and you just have to hop aboard one.  Those stories may be true, but they are uncommon.  And worse, those success stories usually gloss over the many sad aspects of each “win”.  Children abandoned.  Spouses deserted.  A life that is entertaining to others but shallow and meaningless to oneself.  They are so polished or simplified that they are unreal.</p>

<p>My story is a more common Silicon Valley startup experience.  The real story.  Only uncommon in its duration and perseverance.  My family and I have ventured through a total of ten startups.  Most people give up earlier.</p>

<p>Some other aspects are a bit uncommon too, but far more common than the pervasive unicorns.  I am still happily married to my first love.  And we have raised two amazing daughters together.  We are broke, but rich&hellip;.</p>

<h3>Failure: Most Epic</h3>




<div style="float:right">
<img src="/images/Sopa_05_Pasadena_12per.png"  alt="Pasadena">
</div>




<p>My most epic failure was also my fastest. It took only a minute or
two. And it was twenty five years ago, in 1989. Going back to that
fateful evening…</p>




<blockquote><p>Tonight, Rebecca and I are having dinner with our families. It is the night
before we formally walk: tomorrow we get a nice piece of paper for graduating
from Caltech. Graduating from Caltech has not been easy for either of us, so
this is a very significant event. And having most of our family around us is
really nice too. We are incredibly happy.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>An hour or two later I get a call from Rebecca. It is maybe 11PM or
midnight, the night before our graduation. I am a night owl, so I am awake
but I am definitely surprised by the call. Rebecca says something like “Can you
come and get me?” She may also say, “I am in the hospital”, but I am not
sure.  Later in my life, I will know the right answer to this question, but the
two-minute epic failure of my life involves me saying things like “What are you
talking about?”, “You are an hour away”, and “It is graduation night”. The
only right answer is: “Yes, I will be right there!”  Not saying those six simple
words immediately will forever be my life’s crowning failure.</p>

<p>Rebecca had been assaulted at knifepoint&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Three</h3>

</div>


<p>I worked as a contractor and consultant for several years, and then stopped working shortly before my first daughter was born.  About a year and a half later, a friend and coworker asked me if I could help them out.  The company was Evant, earlier named Retail Aspect.</p>

<p>Evant was in the process of landing Staples with their product: a multidimensional retail planning application.  If you take a retailer like The Gap, they have to plan what clothes they will have in the store for each month of the year.  They can use previous years to help their predictions, but each year new styles and colors come out, so it is somewhat a magical art to get the inventories right.  &hellip;  it was a very simple request: could I turn the prototype into the real thing.  In about three months.</p>

</ul>


<h3>Coffee</h3>

<p>I did not drink coffee at all until after college.  &hellip; I know I was a lightweight in the coffee arena.  One day I went to a new coffee shop that does two shots by default.  I was <em>wired</em> that day, and made sure to call the shots (1) in the future &hellip;</p>

<p>The Evant project changed all that.  I had been home with my wife and Maya for at least 18 months.  I mountain biked several times a week, up some serious mountains.  I had plenty of money in the bank, so I didn’t need to work at all… at least for a while longer.  I liked my life.</p>

<p>I also liked the Evant challenge laid before me.  And the Evant team already had several of my friends in it: two were at my wedding.  And the new people I met, I immediately liked them too.  I wanted <em>both lives</em>.  <em>Concurrently</em>.</p>

<p>Turns out, you can do that.  You simply multi-task at some proper unit of granularity.  I picked by the day.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I would go into Evant and work my butt off.  The other four days I would keep my family life.  Maybe responding to an email or doing some work at home, but definitely not at work.  To get what needed to be done, actually done in the timeline we were talking about, was not a part-time task.  It was a normal 40+ hours a week kind of task.  So I worked 12-14 hours each day I went in.  Arrive around 7AM.  Leave at 9PM.  Rarely had lunch.  Really only consumed one kind of food.</p>

<p>There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the Evant building.</p>

<p>I am no longer a lightweight.</p>
