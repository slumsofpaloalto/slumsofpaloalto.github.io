  <div class="entry-content"><p>I launched a Kickstarter!  <a href="http://goo.gl/F4tvuF">http://goo.gl/F4tvuF</a></p>

<p>Basically this was to solve two issues:</p>

<ul>
<li> How do I get a pool of people throughout the country to register into a Private Beta Book pool, so, depending on funds available, I could mail them a Private Beta Book and get their feedback</li>
<li> How do I not run out of money so I can do the above (could cost as much as $100 per PBB) and also keep paying editors, printers, shippers, etc. for each and every round of the book</li>
</ul>


<p>Less than a day later the Kickstarter is 1% funded.  It is a 30-day kKickstarter so that is not a statistically-great omen, but things like local flyers
and even word on the internet don&rsquo;t really kick in that fast.  In maybe 7 days, we should have a real reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last two weeks, my MVB has transformed a bit.  Some feedback to MVB1 made it obvious I was missing something critical: lessons
learned about &lsquo;right&rsquo; and &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; things to do in a startup.  So I added that.  I also one day came up with a minimal viable ending, so
I added that too.  The rest of the changes were due to art.  Or should I say Art!</p>

<p>The concept-art illustrations that came back from my illustrator (Baird) were totally Awesome!  So now my book has front and back covers,
and five internal illustrations.  Yes, these will later change to color, but for now I have a Minimal Viable Cover.</p>

<p>Interestingly, full-color books have more restrictions in size formats.  So I shifted from 5x8 to 5.5x8.5.  This is a logical size, but Adobe
&lsquo;booklet&rsquo; mode puts extra space around the edges, so shrinks it slightly.</p>

<p>The reason for the interest in full-color books is that the artwork in the book (11+ illustrations and 11+ photographs) is going to be amazing,
and if people want it (I do), there will be a full-color version.  Unfortunately it will be quite a bit more expensive, but I may be able to
leverage the color in the normal textual flow as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today all my work (and my life) gave birth to a Minimal Viable Book (MVB).  This is a book
that isn&rsquo;t ready for true publication, but has enough content and structure that you can
tell where it is going.  My MVB1 (there will be at least two more&hellip; I am writing this update 15 days late)
has nice white paper, about 160 5.25x8 pages, and no ending.  The ending chapter is there, but there
is no end in the ending chapter.  But I can print this MVB in booklet form and give it out to various
other people.  I have a book&hellip; a minimal viable book&hellip; but that is still a book!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can&rsquo;t go serving this morning, so instead I wrote a bit more of the book: <a href="/more4">More 4</a>.  This may be one of the last extract sets since I think extracting the
core of the startup stories may be hard to read out of context.  Actually, everything may be hard to read out of the surrounding context, but I am hoping
it is at least amusing.</p>

<p>Almost at 40K words.</p>

<p>Also started a tennis blog at <a href="http://supersonicfox.com/">Supersonic Fox</a> which will have more Tennis-oriented content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With a new month, now we start filling in the software-techy aspects of the book: <a href="/more3">More 3</a>.  This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a major thread since I think other threads are more valuable
to more people, but if you are interested in the software / programming parts, these will be woven in as well.</p>

<p>Passed 30K words.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The raw content of the book surpassed 25,000 words in the last day.  So I added a second &lsquo;<a href="/more2">More 2</a>&rsquo; section to keep
things in manageable size.  A pass at organizing the content has been done as well, so whether the book ends at 50,000 or more
words, it basically has a first full pass at structure and flow.</p>

<p>No agents yet.  I investigated self publishing during the last week, and it certainly seems manageable.  I just rather have someone skilled do what they are skilled at :&ndash;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I added a significantly larger set of samples into the &lsquo;<a href="/more">More</a>&rsquo; section.  I did not want to change the samples section itself because
that is meant to be concise.  I may be missing one or two that should be in there (maybe &lsquo;Dissent&rsquo;) to have more diversity, but
it shouldn&rsquo;t just grow as more chapters seem to be &lsquo;possibly interesting&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;more&rsquo; section may grow over time as basically a
sampling of the entire book.  Enjoy!  And thanks for all the encouragement.  Even some of my agent rejections seemed really encouraging.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier today I decided that I should have a site for the book.  After doing so many startups, and with some great services out there,
launching the IT (or Infrastructure) of a new company is incredibly easy.  A web site is among the easiest of the infrastructure to
set up.  I purchased the domain name, pointed it at github.io, cloned and customized Octopress, and after a few &lsquo;rake generate; rake deploy&rsquo;
edit cycles, the book proposal and this blog posting were up and alive.</p>
