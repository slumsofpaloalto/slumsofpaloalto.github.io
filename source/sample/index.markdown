### Three

I worked as a contractor and consultant for several years, and then stopped working shortly before my first daughter was born.  About a year and a half later, a friend and coworker asked me if I could help them out.  The company was Evant, earlier named Retail Aspect.

Evant was in the process of landing Staples with their product: a multidimensional retail planning application.  If you take a retailer like The Gap, they have to plan what clothes they will have in the store for each month of the year.  They can use previous years to help their predictions, but each year new styles and colors come out, so it is somewhat a magical art to get the inventories right.  Planning tools help the planners work with huge amounts of historical data, huge numbers of stores, and huge number of items.  The planners want quick responses as the transform the plans for the entire fleet of stores.  I forget what Staples store count was, but The Gap has about two thousand stores, so Staples is probably similar.  Two thousand stores, maybe a thousand products, various variations on the products, and planning at the day or week level.  For each product there could be several dozen metrics.  And we also have several years worth of historical data at the item level.  So in total the planning application has to work with billions of data points… at the least.

So Staples loved the Evant product.  Very leading edge UI, flexible planning engine capabilities, etc.  Looked good to go forward into actual production use.  Except for a “little problem”.  The problem was the planning product was a prototype.  And written by someone no longer with the company.  And among the things it could do, dealing with a billion points of data was not one of them.  So it was a very simple request: could I turn the prototype into the real thing.  In about three months.

### Coffee

I did not drink coffee at all until after college.  After college, at some point Rebecca and I found a great bakery and coffee shop on the edge of what became the shopping section of Pasadena called “Old Pasadena”.  Originally this section of town was _very seedy_, and certain kinds of stores (the kind that Rebecca and I would be unlikely to frequent) actually lasted a very long time through the gentrification of the section.  The bakery was at the end, was nice and airy, and looked out over the gorge that now holds the 710.  They served coffee in bowls.  It was very good, and I might partake in a mocha once a week.

When Rebecca and I joined OOCL (Orient Overseas Container Lines) to work on a large Smalltalk project, I think I started drinking a bit more coffee.  May have been just a ritual, and I am not sure whether it was even a daily ritual.  I know I was a lightweight in the coffee arena.  One day I went to a new coffee shop that does two shots by default.  I was _wired_ that day, and made sure to call the shots (1) in the future.

The Evant project changed all that.  I had been home with my wife and Maya for at least 18 months.  I mountain biked several times a week, up some serious mountains.  I had plenty of money in the bank, so I didn’t need to work at all… at least for a while longer.  I liked my life.

I also liked the Evant challenge laid before me.  And the Evant team already had several of my friends in it: two were at my wedding.  And the new people I met, I immediately liked them too.  I wanted _both lives_.  _Concurrently_.

Turns out, you can do that.  You simply multi-task at some proper unit of granularity.  I picked by the day.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I would go into Evant and work my but off.  The other four days I would keep my family life.  Maybe responding to an email or doing some work at home, but definitely not at work.  To get what needed to be done, actually done in the timeline we were talking about, was not a part-time task.  It was a normal 40+ hours a week kind of task.  So I worked 12-14 hours each day I went in.  Arrive around 7AM.  Leave at 9PM.  Rarely had lunch.  Really only consumed one kind of food.

There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the Evant building.

I am no longer a lightweight.
