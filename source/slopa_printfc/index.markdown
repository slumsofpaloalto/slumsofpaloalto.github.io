## The Slums of Palo Alto (Full Color Print Edition)

Approximately two hundred pages with two dozen illustrations and photographs.  

The main throughline is about startups, what they do right and wrong, and how to make them work.  Other throughlines
are how to progress through failure (potentially relentless failure) to achieve incremental and ultimate success, the tradeoffs of 
living in Silicon Valley, and how to have integrity and purpose living and working in the Shark Tank.  Additional topics include family, community, gender bigotry, programming, social responsibility, and education.
