## Synopsis

Silicon Valley, the real story, from a caring family.

The story of a family that has weathered a series of ten startups and the environment
that is the real "Shark Tank": Silicon Valley.  A place where some people are very badly off, others struggle
to keep afloat, but the news continuously reports on the minority of winners, even glossing over
 these winners' dark sides and failures.

An insider view on a series of ten startups, with no unicorns, and the lessons learned from 
their similarities and differences.  

Two daughters raised and educated within the tank by leveraging communities within Palo Alto that most
people have never heard of.  

Relentless failing at work and in life, relentless financial struggle,
and how to progress through it all... because there is no other choice.  Family, community, and commitment come first.
