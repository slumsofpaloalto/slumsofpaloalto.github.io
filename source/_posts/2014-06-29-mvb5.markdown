In the last two weeks, my MVB has transformed a bit.  Some feedback to MVB1 made it obvious I was missing something critical: lessons
learned about 'right' and 'wrong' things to do in a startup.  So I added that.  I also one day came up with a minimal viable ending, so
I added that too.  The rest of the changes were due to art.  Or should I say Art!

The concept-art illustrations that came back from my illustrator (Baird) were totally Awesome!  So now my book has front and back covers,
and five internal illustrations.  Yes, these will later change to color, but for now I have a Minimal Viable Cover.

Interestingly, full-color books have more restrictions in size formats.  So I shifted from 5x8 to 5.5x8.5.  This is a logical size, but Adobe
'booklet' mode puts extra space around the edges, so shrinks it slightly.

The reason for the interest in full-color books is that the artwork in the book (11+ illustrations and 11+ photographs) is going to be amazing,
and if people want it (I do), there will be a full-color version.  Unfortunately it will be quite a bit more expensive, but I may be able to
leverage the color in the normal textual flow as well.
