The books are going live!  Like right now!  You can buy them on Amazon!

   * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slums-Palo-Alto-Preview-ecstatically/dp/0692233199/">English, Black & White</a>
   * English, Full Color!  Expected any day now (final color illustrations are being worked on).
   * Chinese, B&amp;W and Color!  Expected by January
   * Spanish, B&amp;W and Color!  Looking for a Spanish translator.  Please <a href="/contact">Contact Me!</a> if you know of any one.

At least half the profits for all the books go to educational programs.  See <a href="http://MinimalBuyableBook.com/">MinimalBuyableBook.com</a> for
