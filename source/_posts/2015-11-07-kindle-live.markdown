Well, it has been an extra year in the making, but the final version of "The Slums of Palo Alto" is now going live on
Amazon in Kindle, B&W, and Color formats.  Thanks to everyone who has helped along the way, and please 
<a href="/contact">Let Me Know</a> what you think of the new version.  It has been highly edited: things that were
 off the core topics of the book are now gone, the rest is now fleshed out, and I believe the end is _much_ better.
