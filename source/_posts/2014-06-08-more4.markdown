Can't go serving this morning, so instead I wrote a bit more of the book: [More 4](/more4).  This may be one of the last extract sets since I think extracting the
core of the startup stories may be hard to read out of context.  Actually, everything may be hard to read out of the surrounding context, but I am hoping
it is at least amusing.

Almost at 40K words.

Also started a tennis blog at [Supersonic Fox](http://supersonicfox.com/) which will have more Tennis-oriented content.
