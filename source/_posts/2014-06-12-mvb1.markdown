Today all my work (and my life) gave birth to a Minimal Viable Book (MVB).  This is a book
that isn't ready for true publication, but has enough content and structure that you can
tell where it is going.  My MVB1 (there will be at least two more... I am writing this update 15 days late)
has nice white paper, about 160 5.25x8 pages, and no ending.  The ending chapter is there, but there
is no end in the ending chapter.  But I can print this MVB in booklet form and give it out to various
other people.  I have a book... a minimal viable book... but that is still a book!
