It might look like things are very quiet for the book for more than a month, but that is because all the updates shifted to being
on the Kickstarter: <http://goo.gl/F4tvuF>

Since the Kickstarter sends notifications out to everyone who registered, it seemed more logical
to put updates there than here.  Plus the 'registered' people actually committed money to the book,
so like it or not, they are my "More Valued Customers".

But I will update this blog periodically too.  At this point though, I recommend you read through the updates on the kickstarter: <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761729676/the-slums-of-palo-alto-how-to-after-ten-failed-sta/posts>
