Earlier today I decided that I should have a site for the book.  After doing so many startups, and with some great services out there,
launching the IT (or Infrastructure) of a new company is incredibly easy.  A web site is among the easiest of the infrastructure to
set up.  I purchased the domain name, pointed it at github.io, cloned and customized Octopress, and after a few 'rake generate; rake deploy'
edit cycles, the book proposal and this blog posting were up and alive.
