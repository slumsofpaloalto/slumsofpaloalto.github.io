I launched a Kickstarter!  <http://goo.gl/F4tvuF>

Basically this was to solve two issues:

   * How do I get a pool of people throughout the country to register into a Private Beta Book pool, so, depending on funds available, I could mail them a Private Beta Book and get their feedback
   * How do I not run out of money so I can do the above (could cost as much as $100 per PBB) and also keep paying editors, printers, shippers, etc. for each and every round of the book

Less than a day later the Kickstarter is 1% funded.  It is a 30-day kKickstarter so that is not a statistically-great omen, but things like local flyers
and even word on the internet don't really kick in that fast.  In maybe 7 days, we should have a real reading.
