I added a significantly larger set of samples into the '[More](/more)' section.  I did not want to change the samples section itself because
that is meant to be concise.  I may be missing one or two that should be in there (maybe 'Dissent') to have more diversity, but
it shouldn't just grow as more chapters seem to be 'possibly interesting'.  The 'more' section may grow over time as basically a
sampling of the entire book.  Enjoy!  And thanks for all the encouragement.  Even some of my agent rejections seemed really encouraging.
