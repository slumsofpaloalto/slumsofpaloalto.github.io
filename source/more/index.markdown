## Why

This site was created to support the book "The Slums of Palo Alto: How to succeed through relentless failure" written by [Mark Fussell](/bio)
and experienced by him and his whole family: Rebecca, Maya, and Katrina.  Maya and Katrina came into Rebecca and Mark's
 journey long after it started: Maya joined us before Startup #3 and Katrina joined us during Startup #4.

The Slums of Palo Alto is meant to be interesting and informative.  Surviving a series of startups, 
with all the different demands and characters they contained, gives true insights into how they work. Mark never found
a unicorn and no two startups were alike.

Surviving the _slums_ of Palo Alto may provide some insights into the Silicon Valley environment and communities,
and what might be useful to bring into your own life.

Besides providing a glimpse into the real Silicon Valley life, this book is about the reality of failure, 
how to learn from it, and to progress.  Over and over again...



## What

The site is structured primarily around the standard Query Proposal in the non-fiction book industry.
I think most readers should first read the [sample](/sample), then maybe my [bio](/bio), and finally the [synopsis](/synopsis) if you are interested.
If you are an agent, I expect you will reverse that order :-)

If you know an agent that might be interested, please send this site information to them, or let me know
and I will send them (or even better help you send them :-) the standard email format of a Query.

## When

Now!  The first pass of centent was completed in the Summer of 2014.  The current version was finished in November of 2015 after a limited beta
