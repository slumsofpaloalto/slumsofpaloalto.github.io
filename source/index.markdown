The putting green on the balcony overlooked Santa Monica pier.  We were in the suite previously owned by Lawrence Welk, and could watch the taping of Bay Watch every Monday.  During the day it was incredibly beautiful… it was the first of a series of too beautiful to believe buildings that would affect my life.  At night it was a bit scary.  We were building a news palace for a Saudi Prince.  Saudi Princes have a lot of enemies, and when working at night in our beautiful offices it felt like all the enemies of our Prince were figuring out ways to get to me.  Rappel down from the balcony above?  Sneak past the security cameras protecting the elevator?  Apparently the prince was convinced by the Iraq war that CNN was a more reliable way to know what was going on around his country than other means, and he needed a palace of news to make sure he wasn’t about to be overthrown or worse.  I never saw the elevator pitch, but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.

This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  A total of ten startups.  To quickly get rid of any chance of romance… all of them failed.

## Why

This site was created to support the upcoming book "The Slums of Palo Alto: How to be ecstatically happy after ten failed startups" written by [Mark Fussell](/bio)
and experienced by him and his whole family: Rebecca, Maya, and Katrina.  Maya and Katrina came into Rebecca and my journey long after it started, but Maya joined us
before Startup #3 and Katrina joined us during Startup #4.

The book is meant to be interesting and informative.  Surviving ten startups, with all the demands and differences they contained, gives an interesting perspective and understanding.
Surviving the _slums_ of Palo Alto also gives some insights into the world.  And finally, taking a 30+ year journey with a single partner
may provide clues to life that others find interesting.  But besides these glimpses into my journey, this book is about the reality of failure, how to learn from it,
and how to relentlessly try to succeed again.  Over and over and over...

And as for the ultimate 'Why?'.  Because I couldn't not write the book.  I was writing it in my head every week.  I was reading it every week.
One Monday not long ago, I just started typing.  And I hoped by getting it on paper
it would inform and entertain at least one other person.  My daughter Katrina is very entertained, so I am very happy :-)

## What

The site is structured primarily around the standard Query Proposal in the non-fiction book industry.
I think most readers should first read the [sample](/sample), then maybe my [bio](/bio), and finally the [synopsis](/synopsis) if you are interested.
If you are an agent, I expect you will reverse that order :-)

There is also a continuation of samples in [more](/more).  I will add to that periodically.

If you know an agent that might be interested, please send this site information to them, or let me know
and I will send them (or even better help you send them :-) the standard email format of a Query.

## When

I expect to be finished with a first pass of content by the end of Summer 2014.  After that, I will work on a first full structure of the book.  At that point
any and all editorial help will be greatly appreciated.

## Who

My [Bio](/bio) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell) profile.

## Where

I think that is easy to deduce :-) My family and I live near Mitchell Park in Palo Alto, California.

## What Else

There are several companion sites to the book.  They contain more details on specific topics.  So far, there are _seven_ of them:

   * http://SupersonicFox.com/ -- About becoming really good at tennis, even after a thirty year hiatus
