##The Slums of Palo Alto <small>[^1]</small>

[^1]: _How to succeed through relentless failure_

The putting green on the balcony overlooked the Santa Monica pier.  We were in the suite previously owned by Lawrence Welk, and could watch the taping of Baywatch  every Monday.  During the day it was incredibly beautiful… it was the first of a series of too-beautiful-to-believe buildings that would affect my life.  At night it was a bit scary.  We were building a command center for a Saudi Arabian prince.  Saudi princes have a lot of enemies, and when working late at night in our beautiful office it felt like all the enemies of our prince were figuring out ways to get to me.  Rappel down from the balcony above?  Sneak past the security cameras protecting the elevator?  Apparently the prince was convinced by the Iraq war that CNN was a more reliable way to know what was going on around his country than other means, and he needed a command center that processed all this news to make sure he wasn’t about to be overthrown or worse.  I never heard the elevator pitch , but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.

This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  My story is not the story most people tell.  The media talks about Facebook, Apple, Snapchat, and Google.  Silicon valley is all about success: unicorns are everywhere and you just have to hop aboard one.  Those stories may be true, but they are uncommon.  And worse, those success stories usually gloss over the many sad aspects of each “win”.  Children abandoned.  Spouses deserted.  A life that is entertaining to others but shallow and meaningless to oneself.  They are so polished or simplified that they are unreal.

My story is a more common Silicon Valley startup experience.  The real story.  Only uncommon in its duration and perseverance.  My family and I have ventured through a total of ten startups.  Most people give up earlier.  

Some other aspects are a bit uncommon too, but far more common than the pervasive unicorns.  I am still happily married to my first love.  And we have raised two amazing daughters together.  We are broke, but rich.  We have been physically and mentally taxed for more than a decade, but are still thriving and in the best shape of our lives.  

My family and I rent a house in Palo Alto.  We are in the cheaper part of Palo Alto, where lawns are unkempt and foreign investors buy a house and leave it vacant year round.  We are in the slums.  Not because our house is inexpensive.  It is worth approximately two million dollars.  If you live in Palo Alto you commonly use single-digit or two-digit numbers to refer to house prices.  The million is implied.  

But our house is very poorly made: it is cold and hot on those rare days when Palo Alto is either cold or hot.  We lose the phone and Internet connection on those rare days it rains in Palo Alto.  And what makes us truly in the slums: on the first day of any month we could be evicted from our house for being unable to make the payment of five thousand dollars.  My wife and two daughters on the street at a moments notice.  

We are totally in the slums… it just happens that these slums are in the opulent heart of Silicon Valley.  And the only way to get out is to progress… relentlessly…
