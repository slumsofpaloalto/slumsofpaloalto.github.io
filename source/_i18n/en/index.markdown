### Kirkus Review!

  * "A pleasure from start to finish &hellip;"
  * "Fussell brims with intelligence and has a wholly realistic, hard-knocks sense of how business and stock options work in Californiaâ€™s tech epicenter, where startups bloom and often quickly fade away."
    * "His experiences with a string of ten such companies will be of interest to others entering or already in this arena. "
  * "But those throughlines are only part of this wide-ranging expedition into personal philosophy, social responsibility and family values. "

Approximately two hundred pages with two dozen illustrations and photographs.

living in Silicon Valley, and how to have integrity and purpose living and working in the Shark Tank.  Additional topics include family, community, gender bigotry, programming, social responsibility, and education.
