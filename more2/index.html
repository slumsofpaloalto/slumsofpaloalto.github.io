  <h3>Gender</h3>

<p>Females are clearly the superior gender.  Put 100 women and 2 men on a deserted island, and they will have a great chance of building a thriving new community.  Reverse the numbers, and they will be lucky to survive the week.  So females are innately superior and the ratio should really be maybe 10 to 1 in their favor.  Unfortunately nature doesn’t seem to agree and makes the odds one to one.  And mothers, seeing the misshapen baby boys in front of them, take pity on the boys and raise them like their own.  Mothers are wonderful.</p>

<p>Whether men remember this blessing from women in their home life, they definitely don’t seem to remember it in their work world.  Women are treated very badly by men.  Some men may be intentionally treating women differently, and those men are “words I will not use in print”.  But I think the more insidious problem is that many men behave badly to <em>everyone</em> and it is just that women are currently more susceptible to the bad behavior.  Women would thrive in my very classy Startup #2 (DSG).  I think the many women in #3 (small Evant) were treated very well, but you would have to check with them.  One more startup after those might have been good to women.  So excluding my own, at best I would say in three of the nine startups I have been in, the spirit from the CEO downward would make sure women were treated well and equally.  That is 33%.</p>

<p>In the rest of the startups, I am minimally aware of some actual gender bigotry.  But I am totally aware of female-punishing activities.  One startup in particular had a CEO that was so strong willed, eloquent, handsome, and even ‘cute’ that it was hard for women to resist him.  Unfortunately for them, he was an optimizer, and wanted to optimize their salary, free time, and freedom away from them.  My interactions with him were fine.  I received significant promotions, raises, and independence.  Within a few months, I could do what I wanted to because of two things (a) I was visibly and dramatically helping him make his startup succeed, and (b) I made it completely clear in action that I would do what I wanted.  What I wanted were all the right things to make the company successful and the team happy.  But it also included walking out the door if anyone stopped me from doing what I wanted.  The CEO did not like the second rule, but he liked me.  A lot.  And respected me.  Also a lot.  He wrote my headline reference on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, that company had two women, both of which were treated badly.  One was paid poorly and forced to either never leave the office or to be on call any moment she did.  Another was paid poorly, even when she should have an amazing upper hand.  Even when she should had the power to walk.  Walk to a better life.</p>

<h3>Death</h3>

<p>Startups die.  The death of a startup is a hard thing for many people, but it is insanely hard for a founder.  As a founder it really feels like you gave birth to your company.  You raised it for at least two years.  It is a toddler or maybe a teenager.  And it is dying.  Worse than that.  It is dying and you are responsible for putting it down.</p>

<p>I have helped others keep companies alive until they were sold.  And I have watched startups die after I have left.  But the terminal illness of Velidom was so hard to take that I basically denied Velidom died at all.  Even to today.  It is my car’s license plate.</p>

<p>Because employees are ‘protected’ it is the founders responsibility to make sure the death of a startup does not poorly impact them.  They should have a good heads-up so they can find new jobs, and their final wages and PTO should be paid.  But the character of the CEO and the strain of the death of their child can make them behave badly.</p>

<p>There was a woman who was in a company that was clearly terminal.  The product was going nowhere.  The market was going nowhere.  They were making less and less, on fewer and fewer people.  The CEO didn’t believe in pivoting.  There was no more money.  There was absolutely no hope.</p>

<p>One day she came to talk to me and ask me for advice.  She had been offered a position in a large gaming startup down in Sunnyvale.  She was to be some kind of team lead, where currently she was just an individual programmer.  Or more accurately, she was the only programmer because the company could no longer afford any more.  She was lonely and wanted people to learn from.  But her current CEO/founder was telling her how important she was to him and the company.  How the company could make a turnaround, and she would be a critical part of that.  So she asked what should she do.</p>

<p>I told her exactly what I thought she should do.  It is exactly what I would do in her shoes.  I also explained to her what I wrote above.  The company is the founder’s baby.  The baby is all but dead.  This particular founder only really responded to assertive, forceful, and even aggressive actions positively.  And now the founder was suffering from delusions… of life… because it is his baby.  I explained to her that I know I suffered from the same delusions with Velidom.  I do not believe I hurt any employees in the process, and I am not the same kind of person as her founder.  But I have complete empathy for him.  And if I received the offer she had.  I would high tail it away from him (or from me) as fast as I could.</p>

<p>So that was my advice to her.  And given I was in a gaming startup at the time… I knew a fair amount about what other gaming startups were out there.  So I guessed which one she might have been given an offer by, that was located in Sunnyvale.  I told her if it was that company, she should run even faster.  She did not tell me that I was correct until later.</p>

<p>She did not take my advice, and continued working for the dead baby.  This was unfortunate, because the new company and position would likely have been good for her.  I think she could have used the money too.  If they offered her just 0.1% equity, she could have bought something nice.  Like a house.  The company was Playfish.</p>

<h3>Tea Parties</h3>

<p>I have never worked for a startup that was officially run by a woman.  That would actually be very interesting.  The best female bosses I have had, including my mother (I worked for her nonprofit when I was young), have managed to make sure the team knew where we were supposed to head, to clear away any obstacles, and to make us all feel like we were cared for.  That is very good management, in my opinion.  Some of the managers were a little more project management oriented, and status updates mattered a lot to them.  Some were a little less connected with the team.  But in general I have had excellent female managers over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>The closest I had to a startup run by women, was a startup run by a man and a woman where the man “managed like a woman”.  And by that, I mean it to match the expression “throw like a girl”.  In reality, girls throw really well.  I threw my arm out trying to pitch softball… and my daughter now pitches softball… so to me “throwing like my daughter” is clearly a complement.  Although women manage really well, there are stereotypes about how they might manage companies ineffectively.  This company somehow decided to follow one of those stereotypes.  This startup was run by tea party.</p>

<p>We would all get together several times a week, sit around a table, and bring up one or more topics.  Tea was not officially served, but certain people would definitely be eating.  Others would be lunging… apparently good exercise and socially acceptable at the tea party.  Topics would come and go, and by the end of the meeting we would have covered everything on the agenda.  Except absolutely nothing was decided.</p>

<p>There are great benefits to tea parties.  By deciding nothing each time, you could have many more tea parties and not run out of topics.  If you actually had a normal meeting, the number of topics would dwindle as the company truly executed upon an actual strategy.  There were times we had real meetings, and for a couple months I was hopeful.  But even actual forward progress can be thwarted by “maybe we need to rethink this”, and another series of tea parties.  Tea parties about user interfaces are my favorite.</p>
