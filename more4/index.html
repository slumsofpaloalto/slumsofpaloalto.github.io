  <h3>Koi</h3>

<p>Koi are beautiful, large, goldfish.  Koi means “carp” in Japanese, and it is also a homophone with another word that means “love”.  Rebecca, Maya, and Katrina are my Koi.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my Koi live in an aquarium that has an open drain.  It is a beautiful aquarium with many wonderful things in it.  Especially the food is amazing, and the schools exceptional.  Only the ornamental house is a bit run down.  My Koi are beautiful, healthy, and happy fish.  The water is always fresh and clean, because dirty water pours out the drain.  Replenishing fresh water gets poured in the top, every month.  Usually.</p>

<p>How we came to be in The Slums of Palo Alto is a progression of our Slumlord raising the rent repeatedly, so the drain became bigger and bigger.  The drain was a reasonable size when we first moved into Palo Alto.  But the relentless rent increases meant more and more gallons of water would pour out the drain every month.  This was problem one.</p>

<p>Problem two was that I did my own startup (Velidom), which drained our cash reserves severely.  There was a point where Velidom was clearly failing but I still needed to pay employees and other company expenses.  Our family’s reserves were all but flushed away.</p>

<p>These experiences then lead to problem three: After Velidom, I did a series of startups to try to get better as the engineering execution side.  Most of these startups behaved reasonably and lawfully towards employees.  We would negotiate a salary, which would be less than what I wanted but “survivable”.  And we would negotiate a stock percentage, which would ultimately be irrelevant because the stock was destined to be worthless.  As the rent kept increasing, the startup salaries became less clearly survivable.  But I somehow managed to string them all together and keep the aquarium running fairly well.  There was a huge toll on me, but generally the younger Koi had no idea.</p>

<p>Then we get to a “not nice” startup.  With this startup, I had an employment agreement that gave me about 10 gallons a month after taxes.  This was very low (lowest ever actually), but the charter of the company and the possibility of helping others excited me.  The aquarium was draining 10 gallons a month normally, but sometimes more like 12.  This was not an ideal situation, but draining a net extra gallon a month is not catastrophic.  And maybe the startup has potential, will get better funded, and I can renegotiate up to 12 or 14 gallons a month.</p>

<p>Then the “not nice” kicks in.  About a year in, suddenly my paystub is half what it was.  I believe there was some mention of cash-flow issues, which I have some empathy for, but employees are supposed to be protected from these kinds of issues.  You would think the employer would just lay me off, but the issue with the smallest stages of startups is some people are not optional.</p>

<p>I ran <em>all</em> of the production systems.  Even more, all these systems were all run on my accounts.  My credit card was being billed.  I am <em>the only one</em> who could maintain them.  I had written <em>all the software</em> that customers were paying to use.  The company could not afford any more software developers.  They basically couldn’t afford me.  I was later to find out that they had only enough money to fund my four-year employment contract for exactly one year.  And had no intention of putting any more money in.  So when they ran out of money, they couldn’t fire me.  But they could ‘short’ me.  And that is what they did.</p>

<p>So back to my poor Koi.  The aquarium is draining at 10 gallons a month, and I am abruptly filling it with only 5 gallons a month.  This is a serious problem.  You could say I should move to a different aquarium, but this is mid-school-year when this happens.  Changing aquariums would be difficult (new aquariums open up in the summer), and we can’t legally leave Palo Alto while the kids are in school here.  Further, changing aquariums loses a lot of water.  You have to rent the new aquarium, which has its own open drain.  And then moving the Koi to the new aquarium causes more gallons to spill into someone else’s aquarium.  So moving was not really an option.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how to get more water.  My only resources were my particular skills, and the fact that no startup that is shorting you can expect you to work 80 hours a week.  So I now had 40 hours a week to save my Koi.</p>

<h3>Tennis: Punting</h3>

<p>I started playing tennis after a 29 years hiatus because Katrina asked to play.  We had to buy new rackets, and some tennis balls.  Tennis rackets have changed size since when I was young (possibly to continue to embrace failure), and although the size change brought forth some silly rackets, modern rackets are quite fun to play with.  And modern high-speed photography has made it possible to see how the professionals play.  I decided that my game when I was young, and my mentality now, made Federer the perfect person to copy.  I wanted a one-handed powerful forehand, and a one-handed powerful backhand, and a high-percentage but powerful serve.  I was willing to work at these things, and spent many hours a week on the backboard, with a ball machine, and playing people better than me.</p>

<p>During the first six months, my forehand and backhand came alone nicely.  My vollies did also, but I am innately a touch player, so that wasn’t very impressive to me.  The one thing that did not come along nicely was my serve.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would mishit the ball badly, and some times I tore muscles I didn’t know I had.  My percentage serving my first serve was very iffy.  After six months, I was generally better than most other players I was playing with, but when it came to my serve, I had serious problems.  I practiced my serve on my own, and tried to figure out what was going on in matches.  I worked hard on my serve, reviewing Federer and listening to both solicited and unsolicited advice from others.  But there is one thing I never did.</p>

<p>I never ‘punted’.  I had one serve, and if it failed, it failed.  I served it again, and tried to do better. Federer has two real serves, which behave differently but neither is a punt.  He may actually have many more, and like my tennis coach, he can use all of these impressive serves as he wants.  But club tennis players don’t commonly have two serves.  They have one serve and a punt.  Their second serve is just meant to get the ball in play.  Federer doesn’t have a punt, so I don’t either.  I don’t want to practice something I don’t want.  I practice what I do want.  And accept failure if I fail.</p>

<p>A few players griped to me about my needing to get the ball into play.  If everyone griped and I had no one to play with, I would actually accept that.  I needed to practice on my own more.  But I was good enough that most players accepted my iffy serve in exchange for my other talents.</p>

<p>About nine months in, my iffy serve became no longer as iffy.  It became pretty dangerous.  Nine months of failing, and I was finally succeeding.  I serve at about 90 MPH.  Federer is better, but none of the gripers are even close.</p>

<p>I then started learning a second real serve.  I call it &ldquo;Thing-B&rdquo;, and it is currently very iffy.</p>

<h3>Family: Eastern</h3>

<p>To be part of an Eastern family, you must obey the rules of eastern families.  These rules include a very simple “show up” rule.  If someone is getting married, you show up.  If someone dies, you show up.  People may not know your name, or speak your language, but if you continue to show up, people will take notice of that, and will eventually start expecting you to show up more no matter how strange you look.  This is kind of like “Wedding Crashers” but somehow flipped in its universe.</p>

<p>Next you must do whatever you can do for other family members.  If someone wants to visit Palo Alto, and you live in Palo Alto, then you should offer them room, board, tourism, and even the “how to get a job here” package.  You may have met the person, or they could be a distant third cousin twice removed.  The offer is the same.  These things are very easy to offer if you view the clan as just a little larger than your atomic family: you would certainly do any of these things trivially for you son or daughter, right?</p>

<p>Finally, when you become an elder in an eastern family, you should graciously pay for all meals and produce great quantities of large value “hongbao” (red pockets).  Red pockets are envelopes, and in them is money.  Hongbao are the primary mechanism to enable elders to transfer wealth to non-atomic youngsters in the extended family.  I believe I have the order right, and doing is more meaningful than financing, but I am not sure.  Large amounts of money move via Hongbao, and having a geographically near Aunt (#6) and Uncle has prevented me from being put into the true elder position and bearing the full weight of the intra-family financing.  But Rebecca and I are ready whenever we are promoted: however Western I am on the outside, I am a Shen on the inside.  I carry lots of new hundred-dollar bills, which could easily be placed inside fancy red envelopes.  I love this family.</p>

<h3>Seven</h3>

<p>“Always Google the CEO.” That is one of several of my many recommendations for deciding whether to work for a startup, and for knowing what you are getting into if you choose to join.  Startups in their young years are completely the reflection of the CEO and whatever “right hand” (or first lieutenant) the CEO has.  Yes, there can be cofounders who provide spirit to the company, and these can certainly flavor the environment.  And catalysts can do a lot to the environment too.  But if the CEO or his “hand” want things to go a certain way, then they definitely will.  So make sure you find out as much as possible before you start.  Take the interviews very seriously: you are interviewing them to figure out what that company is really like.  Ask nicely and people will commonly tell you many interesting things.  They may tell you things that very much change your mind.</p>

<p>A coworker at ‘seven’ has a different recommendation than mine, and combining the two might avoid you much grief. “Never work for a convicted felon”.</p>

<h3>Homes</h3>

<p>When I grew up, I lived in a single house, so naturally I always called it my home.  Even when I went to boarding school, I did not change my home.  Unlike Harry Potter, school was school and home was my parent’s house.  We would vacation and return home.  I would go to school and return home.</p>

<p>When I went to college and found the love of my life, the definition of ‘home’ became very confusing.  My classic ‘home’ was my parent’s house.  But when I went there one winter without Rebecca, it was clearly not where I wanted to be.  I wanted to be with her, or I was not in any kind of ‘home’ at all.  But at Caltech people commonly shifted rooms every year, and for quite some time Rebecca and I did not share an apartment.  That would have to wait until after my epic failure.  So my ‘home’ could no longer be attached to any place.  I could either view myself as homeless or simply revise my definition of ‘home’.  I did the latter, and for 30 years, my definition of ‘home’ is simple: it is being with Rebecca.  If I am with her, whether in Palo Alto or Bangalore, in a car or a plane, awake or asleep, then I am home.</p>

<h3>Homes: Motor</h3>

<p>Compared to Mobile Homes, Motor Homes are totally awesome in pretty much every way imaginable.  Motor Homes are sometimes called RVs (for Recreation Vehicles), but that is a misnomer for the truly awesome MH.   A fun RV can sleep two to four people, might have some kind of sink and maybe some kind of stove, and can nicely move down the road at 60 MPH and maybe 15 MPG.  That is definitely fun, but it is not awesome.</p>

<p>A MH is not a vehicle first, it is a home first.  Or at least a house first, with the home-ness provided by the occupants.  To be a MH you must (a) have bathrooms, a kitchen, and beds, (b) be able to have a mortgage because this is clearly a house not just a financeable vehicle, and &copy; be able to move within a few minutes notice.  Note that the movement is last.  If English was a bit more eloquent, the MH would become an HM and stand for a “House, most mobile”.</p>

<p>Because we live in the Slums of Palo Alto, the first house we will ever own, the first property we will ever have a mortgage for, is likely to be: a house, most mobile.</p>
