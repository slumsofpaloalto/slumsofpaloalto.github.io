  <h3>Koi</h3>

<p>Koi are beautiful, large, goldfish.  Koi means “carp” in Japanese, and it is also a homophone with another word that means “love”.  Rebecca, Maya, and Katrina are my Koi.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my Koi live in an aquarium that has an open drain.  It is a beautiful aquarium with many wonderful things in it.  Especially the food is amazing, and the fish schools exceptional.  Only the ornamental house is a bit run down.  And my Koi are beautiful, healthy, and happy fish.  The water is always fresh and clean, because dirty water pours out the drain.  Replenishing fresh water gets poured in the top, every month.  Usually.</p>

<p>How we came to be in The Slums of Palo Alto is a progression of our Slumlord raising the rent repeatedly, so the drain became bigger and bigger.  The drain was a reasonable size when we first moved into Palo Alto.  But the relentless rent increases meant more and more gallons of water would pour out the drain every month.  This was problem one.</p>

<p>Problem two was that I did my own startup (Velidom), which drained our cash reserves severely.  There was a point where Velidom was clearly failing but I still needed to pay employees and other company expenses.  Our family’s reserves were all but flushed away.</p>

<p>These experiences then lead to problem three: After Velidom, I did a series of startups to try to get better as the engineering execution side.  Most of these startups behaved reasonably and lawfully towards employees.  We would negotiate a salary, which would be less than what I wanted but “survivable”.  And we would negotiate a stock percentage, which would ultimately be irrelevant because the stock was destined to be worthless.  As the rent kept increasing, the startup salaries became less clearly survivable.  But I somehow managed to string them all together and keep the aquarium running fairly well.  There was a huge toll on me, but generally the younger Koi had no idea.</p>

<p>Then we get to a “not nice” startup.  With this startup, I had an employment agreement that gave me about 10 gallons a month after taxes.  This was very low (lowest ever actually), but the charter of the company and the possibility of helping others excited me.  The aquarium was draining 10 gallons a month normally, but sometimes more like 12.  This was not an ideal situation, but draining a net extra gallon a month is not catastrophic.  And maybe the startup has potential, will get better funded, and I can renegotiate up to 12 or 14 gallons a month.</p>

<p>Then the “not nice” kicks in.  About a year in, suddenly my paystub is half what it was.  I believe there was some mention of cash-flow issues, which I have some empathy for, but employees are supposed to be protected from these kinds of issues.  You would think the employer would just lay me off, but the issue with the smallest stages of startups is some people are not optional.</p>

<p>I ran <em>all</em> of the production systems.  Even more, all these systems were all run on my accounts.  My credit card was being billed.  I am <em>the only one</em> who could maintain them.  I had written <em>all the software</em> that customers were paying to use.  The company could not afford any more software developers.  They basically couldn’t afford me.  I was later to find out that they had only enough money to fund my four-year employment contract for exactly one year.  And had no intention of putting any more money in.  So when they ran out of money, they couldn’t fire me.  But they could ‘short’ me.  And that is what they did.</p>

<p>So back to my poor Koi.  The aquarium is draining at 10 gallons a month, and I am filling it at 5 gallons a month.  This is a serious problem.  You could say I should move to a different aquarium, but this is mid-school-year when this happens.  Changing aquariums would be difficult (new aquariums open up in the summer), and we can’t legally leave Palo Alto while the kids are in school here.  Further, changing aquariums loses a lot of water.  You have to rent the new aquarium, which has its own open drain.  And then moving the Koi to the new aquarium causes more gallons to spill into someone else’s aquarium.  So moving was not really an option.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how to get more water.  My only resources were my particular skills, and the fact that no startup that is shorting you can expect you to work 80 hours a week.  So I now had 40 hours a week to save my Koi.</p>

<h3>Tennis: Punting</h3>

<p>I started playing tennis after a 29 years hiatus because Katrina asked to play.  We had to buy new rackets, and some tennis balls.  Tennis rackets have changed size since when I was young (possibly to continue to embrace failure), and although the size change brought forth some silly rackets, modern rackets are quite fun to play with.  And modern high-speed photography has made it possible to see how the professionals play.  I decided that my game when I was young, and my mentality now, made Federer the perfect person to copy.  I wanted a one-handed powerful forehand, and a one-handed powerful backhand, and a high-percentage but powerful serve.  I was willing to work at these things, and spent many hours a week on the backboard, with a ball machine, and playing people better than me.</p>

<p>During the first six months, my forehand and backhand came alone nicely.  My vollies did also, but I am innately a touch player, so that wasn’t very impressive to me.  The one thing that did not come along nicely was my serve.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would mishit the ball badly, and some times I tore muscles I didn’t know I had.  My percentage serving my first serve was very iffy.  After six months, I was generally better than most other players I was playing with, but when it came to my serve, I had serious problems.  I practiced my serve on my own, and tried to figure out what was going on in matches.  I worked hard on my serve, reviewing Federer and listening to both solicited and unsolicited advice from others.  But there is one thing I never did.</p>

<p>I never ‘punted’.  I had one serve, and if it failed, it failed.  I served it again, and tried to do better. Federer has two real serves, which behave differently but neither is a punt.  He may actually have many more, and like my tennis coach, he can use all of these impressive serves as he wants.  But club tennis players don’t commonly have two serves.  They have one serve and a punt.  Their second serve is just meant to get the ball in play.  Federer doesn’t have a punt, so I don’t either.  I don’t want to practice something I don’t want.  I practice what I do want.  And accept failure if I fail.</p>

<p>A few players griped to me about my needing to get the ball into play.  If everyone griped and I had no one to play with, I would actually accept that.  I needed to practice on my own more.  But I was good enough that most players accepted my iffy serve in exchange for my other talents.</p>

<p>About nine months in, my iffy serve became no longer as iffy.  It became pretty dangerous.  Nine months of failing, and I was finally succeeding.  I serve at about 90 MPH.  Federer is better, but none of the gripers are even close.</p>

<p>I then started learning a second real serve.  I call it &ldquo;Thing-B&rdquo;, and it is currently very iffy.</p>
