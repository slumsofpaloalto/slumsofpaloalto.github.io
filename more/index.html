  <h3>Community</h3>

<p>Palo Alto has many labeled neighborhoods.  If you look at a Google map of the city you will see them: Professorville, Old Palo Alto, Leland Manor, Triple El, and so on.  I think I count twenty-four of them.  Palo Alto is 24 square miles, so a neighborhood for every square mile.  Seemed a bit strange at first, but now it just is.  We used to live in Leland Manor, Steve Jobs lived in Old Palo Alto, one of Maya’s friends lives in Downtown North, and we now live in St. Claire Gardens.  The naming system is actually very convenient and a little more artistic than the LA driving directions.</p>

<p>But living in a labeled neighborhood does not create a community.  You need people to create communities.  When we lived in Leland Manor we had Rebecca’s aunt two doors away, a very nice family diagonally opposite, and a couple more semi-social households.  Our next-door neighbors were very quiet, either due to age on the one side or to the stresses of paying for a million dollar house on the other.  Our neighborhood was not a community until one family, really one person, insisted that it should be.  I will call her ‘V’.</p>

<p>V moved to Palo Alto from San Francisco.  Her parents live a couple towns north, in Atherton, but it seemed as though for most of her adult life, V wanted to be quite independent from them.  V’s family included a son the same age as Katrina, and later would include a daughter a bit younger.  V was a firefighter.  When the decision had to be made, she decided the risk to her family was not worth the early retirement that the occupation provided.  So V simply dropped the ‘fire’ off her occupation.</p>

<p>V and her family fought with the tiny house they were given, and turned it into a very nice layout, with an amazing kitchen, and all the necessities for a tight family.  V and her family fought with the yard, and now it is a farm and has a tree that Katrina can’t keep her hands off.  V fought to have the neighbors all know each other, and with yearly block parties and just general social interaction, that ultimately became a reality.  We had a community in Leland Manor, and V was the glue.</p>

<p>At approximately the same time that V glued together our proximate neighbors, we were becoming an integral part of another community.  Somehow Rebecca had heard of a nursery school called Parents Nursery School, and we were now a part of it.  When Rebecca and I were looking for nursery schools, we saw a number of different variations.  Some were clean and pleasant, some were clean and almost industrial, some were a bit more disorganized, and then there was PNS.  PNS seemed to be a war between Kids and Nature, and Adults and Order.  The kids were winning, and the adults were happy to see it, if a bit frazzled trying to keep them alive.</p>

<p>Where modern playgrounds have nice rubber surfaces, PNS simply put tires on top of the ‘curb’ that surrounded the play structures. Where most schools tried to protect their flora, the kids at PNS would constantly be bouncing on the trees and running through the ivy.  At PNS, kids were free to be kids, as long as they did not hurt each other, they included each other in their activities (“you can’t say you can’t play”), and they at least approximately did what the teacher said they should do.</p>

<p>PNS was a cooperative.  Parents were actually “in school” learning how to teach children.  There were also mandatory nighttime classes, but the bulk of the time was spent in school.  Rebecca was the primary time-contributor to all our cooperative schooling, but when Maya went through PNS, I was there fairly often too.  Sometimes I was there in the main part of the school day, but more likely during working weekends.  One year I drew all different kinds of smiley faces on the playground tires when I re-holed them.  The holes were to let water drain, and the faces showed ‘up’.  Another time I helped rebuild a water table.  And another I dug a hundred holes to stash buried treasures for the kids to find.  PNS was a lot of fun, and was definitely an important community to us.</p>

<h3>Horses and Dragons and Rams</h3>

<p>Being of both western and eastern decent, our family has two zodiacs that we know.  The western zodiac says we are a bull, a ram, and two scorpions.  That doesn’t really make much sense with our personalities, so it is ‘amusing’.  The eastern zodiac says I am a fire horse.  That totally fits: I was running full speed, blazing over the hills of eastern America.  I felt like something totally alien to my environments. I was having fun, but I didn’t belong here.  Then I came to California, and on a brief visit to Catalina, I saw, on the top bunk, another fire horse.  Rebecca.  And from that point forward I wanted to run with her.  We have been running together for 30 years.</p>

<p>Maya is a golden dragon.  That totally fits too.  Maya is amazing.  She is very quiet while being very social.  She has great humility while having incredible talents.  She is a hidden dragon.  She looks like a young woman, but she could conquer the world.  Fortunately she seems to be a very friendly and good dragon.</p>

<p>Katrina is a water ram.  That <em>totally</em> fits.  Katrina is also amazing, but the first thing you will encounter with her is a butting of heads.  Hard.  Like she wants to make you unconscious with her intellectual power.  Katrina could also conquer the world, so we are working very hard to make sure she is a well-adjusted young woman who seeks to do good things.  Otherwise, we all better get out of here.</p>

<h3>Slumlords</h3>

<p>You aren’t intrinsically a “slumlord” by owning a slummy kind of house in Palo Alto.  The houses aren’t that bad to intrinsically be a slum, so the landlord has to <em>behave</em> like a slumlord to be a slumlord.  Although we have been in Palo Alto for many years, we have had only one slumlord so far.</p>

<p>Luckily, we are relatively immune to most of the negative aspects of slumlords.</p>

<p>We replaced a 1950s stove with something a bit more current.  A noisy and ineffective dishwasher, with something very quiet.  An energy-guzzling old refrigerator with a reasonably green one.  All the showerheads became both water-saving and more effective.  We removed all the drapes in the house because they were ratty and disgusting.  Everything we did was reversible.  The items we removed were placed into storage above and in front of the strange drop-in room in the garage.  Things like the refrigerator were put in the garage too, in case the slumlords were going to be unreasonable on the value of the new one.</p>

<p>For many years, I was not sure if our landlords were slumlords.  Maybe they just had exceedingly bad taste?  Supposedly they had lived in this house for at a few months, lived in the squalor, so squalor was natural to them.  When we suggested that the house needed to be painted before we moved in, they seemed to think that quite novel.  Walls as grimy as the curtains just made sense.  Having clean white walls was novel.  The painter we hired did a great job, and the house looked and worked a lot better after we transformed it.  We had beaten back the power of the slumlords by simply “owning” the house.  I think other tenants would not have enough gumption to do that and would have been at the slumlords mercy.  Or they would simply move out after they realized what was going on.</p>

<h3>Dissent</h3>

<p>About a year after I left Evant, they were successfully sold to Manhattan Associates.  The sale was not at a very good price, and by this point there were Series-C and Series-B shares along with the Series-A and Common.  Startup stocks have two very simple core rules: “Preferred gets money before Common”, and “Last in, First out”.  You can have various other rules too based on the actual preferences in a preferred stock, but these rarely affect the core rules.  The sale price was so low that Common was wiped out.  This is actually “common” if unfortunate.  People with common stock did not put any money in, so if it is a down sale, there is no reason for them to expect to get money at all.  All the preferred shares put money in, and can reasonably expect to get their money back if at all possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the sale price was so low that Series-A was going to get nothing too.  I believe that is less common, but it clearly possible.  The price was such that Series-C was going to get its money back (actually more than that, based on a preference), and Series-B was going to get its money back.  But Series-A was going to get nothing.  I was not amused.  I had received Series-A stock in lieu of cash owed to me, and I wanted <em>my money</em> back.  I was being a nice guy to let them give me stock at the time, but I am not a pushover.  So when I received a letter stating, “you will get nothing”, I was very angry.  I understood the supposed core rules, but felt that the “Last in, First out” was unfair.  We all put money in.  Evant put my money in without me even wanting it to.  So we should all get a portion relative to the amount of money we put in.</p>

<p>As a CEO, you can’t actually just unilaterally sell a company.  You have to get the investors to agree.  How many investors?  Well, it used to be all investors.  Unanimous agreement.  So my anger could have simply killed the acquisition.  Evant would have been dead in the water because they couldn’t convince me to agree to do something for “less than nothing”.  Historically this turned out to be problematic.  So states changed the rules and made sales possible with majorities.  But in exchange they enable investors to “dissent”.  A dissenting investor will not block the sale, but will be able to get their money back because they don’t want to participate in the sale.  They don’t want to be part of the new company.</p>

<p>So I wrote the people in charge a poignant email, and calculated what portion of the proceeds I should get given my percentage of investment dollar.  Who ever I was talking with, wrote back and said something like “That isn’t going to happen!”  We may have conversed a few more times with me clearly stating I was not going to agree to the sale, that I was dissenting, and that the law is pretty obvious on this.  I believe the other side kept saying nothing was going to happen.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, an envelope comes from Manhattan Associates to me.  Inside it there is no letter or any form of explanation.  But there is a check.  A nicely sized check.  I deposited it that day.</p>
