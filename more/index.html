  <h2>The Slums of Palo Alto <sup><small><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></small></sup></h2>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>Palo Alto has many labeled neighborhoods.  If you look at a Google map of the city you will see them: Professorville, Old Palo Alto, Leland Manor, Triple El, and so on.  I think I count twenty-four of them.  Palo Alto is 24 square miles, so a neighborhood for every square mile.  Seemed a bit strange at first, but now it just is.  We used to live in Leland Manor, Steve Jobs lived in Old Palo Alto, one of Maya’s friends lives in Downtown North, and we now live in St. Claire Gardens.  The naming system is actually very convenient and a little more artistic than the LA driving directions.</p>

<p>But living in a labeled neighborhood does not create a community.  You need people to create communities.  When we lived in Leland Manor we had Rebecca’s aunt two doors away, a very nice family diagonally opposite, and a couple more semi-social households.  Our next-door neighbors were very quiet, either due to age on the one side or to the stresses of paying for a million dollar house on the other.  Our neighborhood was not a community until one family, really one person, insisted that it should be.  I will call her ‘V’.</p>

<p>V moved to Palo Alto from San Francisco.  Her parents live a couple towns north, in Atherton, but it seemed as though for most of her adult life, V wanted to be quite independent from them.  V’s family included a son the same age as Katrina, and later would include a daughter a bit younger.  V was a firefighter.  When the decision had to be made, she decided the risk to her family was not worth the early retirement that the occupation provided.  So V simply dropped the ‘fire’ off her occupation.</p>

<p>V and her family fought with the tiny house they were given, and turned it into a very nice layout, with an amazing kitchen, and all the necessities for a tight family.  V and her family fought with the yard, and now it is a farm and has a tree that Katrina can’t keep her hands off.  V fought to have the neighbors all know each other, and with yearly block parties and just general social interaction, that ultimately became a reality.  We had a community in Leland Manor, and V was the glue.</p>

<p>At approximately the same time that V glued together our proximate neighbors, we were becoming an integral part of another community.  Somehow Rebecca had heard of a nursery school called Parents Nursery School, and we were now a part of it.  When Rebecca and I were looking for nursery schools, we saw a number of different variations.  Some were clean and pleasant, some were clean and almost industrial, some were a bit more disorganized, and then there was PNS.  PNS seemed to be a war between Kids and Nature, and Adults and Order.  The kids were winning, and the adults were happy to see it, if a bit frazzled trying to keep them alive.</p>

<p>Where modern playgrounds have nice rubber surfaces, PNS simply put tires on top of the ‘curb’ that surrounded the play structures. Where most schools tried to protect their flora, the kids at PNS would constantly be bouncing on the trees and running through the ivy.  At PNS, kids were free to be kids, as long as they did not hurt each other, they included each other in their activities (“you can’t say you can’t play”), and they at least approximately did what the teacher said they should do.</p>

<p>PNS was a cooperative.  Parents were actually “in school” learning how to teach children.  There were also mandatory nighttime classes, but the bulk of the time was spent in school.  Rebecca was the primary time-contributor to all our cooperative schooling, but when Maya went through PNS, I was there fairly often too.  Sometimes I was there in the main part of the school day, but more likely during working weekends.  One year I drew all different kinds of smiley faces on the playground tires when I re-holed them.  The holes were to let water drain, and the faces showed ‘up’.  Another time I helped rebuild a water table.  And another I dug a hundred holes to stash buried treasures for the kids to find.  PNS was a lot of fun, and was definitely an important community to us.</p>
