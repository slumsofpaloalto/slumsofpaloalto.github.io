  <h3>Love: Nature</h3>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="/images/Sopa_04_Nature_w12per.png"  alt="Nature">
</div>


<p>Nature has an incredible influence on humans.  Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Bryce, Tahoe, Muir Woods, and many other natural wonders have heavily influenced my family and me.  They are amazing.  You need to see them.  If you have a chance, put this book down right now and make the reservation.  Then pick it back up: you can bring it with you.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Rebecca and I are especially enchanted by Yosemite.  It is awesome, and its awe changes with the seasons, and with the shape of our family.  Rebecca and I went several times when we were young.  We have sat on the top of the fissures staring down several thousand feet at the beautiful valley floor beneath us.  Today, just thinking about it, makes me shudder.  I don’t think at my current age I could sit there and look down.  Too many images of accidentally “taking a leap” fly through my head.</p>

<p>Rebecca and I have also tried to hike up the mist trail to Nevada falls in the winter, but were ultimately repelled by snow and ice.  And one Spring, our whole family caught giant snowflakes that poured down on us in a freakish April snowstorm.  Yosemite is amazing.  And so are all the other national treasures.  Sometimes politicians do the right thing.</p>

<h3>Kindness: Bunnies</h3>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="/images/Sopa_08_Bunny_12per.png"  alt="Bunny">
</div>


<p>&hellip;One morning, when maybe going out to fish, I encountered a bunny.  The bunny had not had a good day.  Apparently it argued with a cat or other predator, and although it (or maybe I) convinced that other animal to go away, the other animal had done some serious damage in the process.  A rear leg was not really attached anymore, and blood was coming from many different parts of the bunny.  But the bunny was alive.  It was incredibly cute.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I picked up the bunny, and held it.  I had never had something so small, cute, and cuddly in my hands before.  I so wanted to keep this incredible source of happiness as my pet.  Too have my own little bunny, which I would take care of and it would make me happy.</p>

<p>But the extent of the injuries made it obvious that this was not to be&hellip;.</p>

<p>The putting green on the balcony overlooked the Santa Monica pier. &hellip;  I never heard the elevator pitch , but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.</p>

<p>This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  My story is not the story most people tell.  The media talks about Facebook, Apple, Snapchat, and Google.  Silicon valley is all about success: unicorns are everywhere and you just have to hop aboard one.  Those stories may be true, but they are uncommon.  And worse, those success stories usually gloss over the many sad aspects of each “win”.  Children abandoned.  Spouses deserted.  A life that is entertaining to others but shallow and meaningless to oneself.  They are so polished or simplified that they are unreal.</p>

<p>My story is a more common Silicon Valley startup experience.  The real story.  Only uncommon in its duration and perseverance.  My family and I have ventured through a total of ten startups.  Most people give up earlier.</p>

<p>Some other aspects are a bit uncommon too, but far more common than the pervasive unicorns.  I am still happily married to my first love.  And we have raised two amazing daughters together.  We are broke, but rich&hellip;.</p>

<h3>失敗：悲劇史詩</h3>




<p>我最悲劇的失敗經驗也是最快速的一次。只花了一兩分鐘。事情發生在二十年前，1989年。讓我們回到那命運的夜晚&hellip;</p>




<p>—————</p>




<blockquote><p>今晚，我和音希正和家人一道用餐。這是我們正式起步的前夕：明天我們就要從加州理工學院畢業，領到那張美好的文憑了。從這所學院畢業對我們倆來說都不容易，所以這是件大事。家人圍繞在身邊也很棒。我們快樂極了。</p>

<p>音希有隻貓叫胡迪尼。胡迪尼原本是隻流浪貓，音希發現她，替她洗乾淨，於是一隻漂亮的挪威森林貓就出現了。胡迪尼非常聰明又很友善。她是所有我養過和看過的貓裡最棒的。她之所以被取名為「海麗葉特・胡迪尼」，是因為她像脫逃大師胡迪尼一樣擁有逃脫密室的能力。學校生活的這幾年中，音希有個朋友住在學院附近的房子，她有時會把胡迪尼寄放在這裡。白天時，胡迪尼都被安全地鎖在一個房間裡，門窗都是關閉的，但到了下午，她就會神奇地脫逃，然後出現在屋外，在院子裡閒逛。這種事發生過好幾次。那個朋友發誓他沒有把貓放出來。這就是她名字的由來。</p>

<p>但今晚，胡迪尼待在音希母親奇諾市的公寓裡，位於帕薩迪納東邊四十分鐘左右的距離。音希在那套公寓裡住了大約半年，因為胡迪尼還在那，所以音希要回去餵她。音希大部份的衣物也都在那，所以她也要回去換衣服。於是晚餐後，我心愛的妻子音希就往奇諾去了。一兩個鐘頭後，我接到音希的電話。那時大概是半夜十一或十二點，我們畢業的前夕。我是個夜貓子，所以我還醒著，但我接到電話的確很驚訝。音希說了「你可以來接我嗎？」之類的話。她可能也說了「我在醫院」，但我不確定。我在未來的人生裡就會知道真正的答案了，但我生命中這兩分鐘的悲劇性失敗是因為我說了像「妳在講什麼？」、「到妳那要一個小時耶」還有「明天就是畢業典禮了」等等的話。此刻唯一的正確答案應該是：「好的，我馬上到！」因為我沒有說出這六個簡單的字，這就成了我人生中最大的失敗。</p>

<p>音希在奇諾公寓的車棚裡被人用尖刀襲擊了。不管那人只是要錢，還是有更糟的企圖，我們都無從得知。音希大聲尖叫，然後不可思議地空手奪刃。刀刃的部分！幸好這英勇的舉動把兇手嚇跑了。音希打了911，然後被警察送去醫院。</p>

<p>她是從那裡打給我的。在刀口下倖存之後。再強調一次，這是我人生最慘的失敗。這也是我當下立志絕不再犯的失敗。絕不再讓她失望。我們走過來了，第二天也正式畢業。音希的手指包紮起來，以保護傷口和縫線。我們倆都很累，但很快樂。</p></blockquote>

<p>從那之後我們極少分開。至今已二十五年了。</p>

<p>I worked as a contractor and consultant for several years, and then stopped working shortly before my first daughter was born.  About a year and a half later, a friend and coworker asked me if I could help them out.  The company was Evant, earlier named Retail Aspect.</p>

<p>Evant was in the process of landing Staples with their product: a multidimensional retail planning application.  If you take a retailer like The Gap, they have to plan what clothes they will have in the store for each month of the year.  They can use previous years to help their predictions, but each year new styles and colors come out, so it is somewhat a magical art to get the inventories right.  &hellip;  it was a very simple request: could I turn the prototype into the real thing.  In about three months.</p>

</ul>


<h3>Coffee</h3>

<p>I did not drink coffee at all until after college.  &hellip; I know I was a lightweight in the coffee arena.  One day I went to a new coffee shop that does two shots by default.  I was <em>wired</em> that day, and made sure to call the shots (1) in the future &hellip;</p>

<p>The Evant project changed all that.  I had been home with my wife and Maya for at least 18 months.  I mountain biked several times a week, up some serious mountains.  I had plenty of money in the bank, so I didn’t need to work at all… at least for a while longer.  I liked my life.</p>

<p>I also liked the Evant challenge laid before me.  And the Evant team already had several of my friends in it: two were at my wedding.  And the new people I met, I immediately liked them too.  I wanted <em>both lives</em>.  <em>Concurrently</em>.</p>

<p>Turns out, you can do that.  You simply multi-task at some proper unit of granularity.  I picked by the day.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I would go into Evant and work my butt off.  The other four days I would keep my family life.  Maybe responding to an email or doing some work at home, but definitely not at work.  To get what needed to be done, actually done in the timeline we were talking about, was not a part-time task.  It was a normal 40+ hours a week kind of task.  So I worked 12-14 hours each day I went in.  Arrive around 7AM.  Leave at 9PM.  Rarely had lunch.  Really only consumed one kind of food.</p>

<p>There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the Evant building.</p>

<p>I am no longer a lightweight.</p>
