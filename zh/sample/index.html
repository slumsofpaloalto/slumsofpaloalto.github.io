  <h2>The Slums of Palo Alto <small><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></small></h2>




<p>The putting green on the balcony overlooked Santa Monica pier.  We were in the suite previously owned by Lawrence Welk, and could watch the taping of Bay Watch every Monday.  During the day it was incredibly beautiful… it was the first of a series of too beautiful to believe buildings that would affect my life.  At night it was a bit scary.  We were building a news palace for a Saudi Prince.  Saudi Princes have a lot of enemies, and when working at night in our beautiful offices it felt like all the enemies of our Prince were figuring out ways to get to me.  Rappel down from the balcony above?  Sneak past the security cameras protecting the elevator?  Apparently the prince was convinced by the Iraq war that CNN was a more reliable way to know what was going on around his country than other means, and he needed a palace of news to make sure he wasn’t about to be overthrown or worse.  I never saw the elevator pitch, but it could have been “Keep your neck with a palace of news”.</p>




<p>This was the first of many startups that I was to be a part of.  A total of ten startups.  To quickly get rid of any chance of romance… all of them failed.  A couple earned my family some amount of money, but those earnings were little more than a yearly bonus.  A couple cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost wages.  And when I was at the helm: I managed to lose approximately one million dollars of my own and my friends money.  All of these startups played major havoc with my life and my health, with my wife and my children.  For a decade I felt that we could be evicted almost instantly: my wife and two daughters on the street at a moments notice.</p>




<p>But after venturing through a total of ten failed startups, I am amongst the happiest people you will ever meet.  I have an amazing family whom I totally love.  I can make amazing things happen for people who I love deeply or even barely know.  I am now “Neo” and having taken the red pill can now interact with the world in ways I could never imagine as a confident but shy teenager.  I don’t know why I am here, but I totally know <em>that</em> I am here.  And if I am here, I am going to make things happen.  Amazing things.  For anyone and everyone.</p>




<p>My family and I rent a house in Palo Alto.  The cheaper part of Palo Alto, where lawns are unkempt and foreign investors buy a house and leave it vacant year round.  We are in the slums.  Not because our house is cheap.  It is worth approximately one point five million dollars.  If you live in Palo Alto you normally use single or two digit numbers to refer to house prices.  The million is implied.  But our house is very poorly made: it is cold and hot on those rare days that Palo Alto is either cold or hot.  We lose the phone and Internet connection on those rare days it rains in Palo Alto.  And what makes us truly in the slums: on any day we could be evicted for being unable to make the monthly payment of five thousand dollars. We are totally in the slums… it just happens that these slums are in the opulent heart of Silicon Valley.</p>

<h3>失敗：悲劇史詩</h3>




<p>我最悲劇的失敗經驗也是最快速的一次。只花了一兩分鐘。事情發生在二十年前，1989年。讓我們回到那命運的夜晚&hellip;</p>




<p>—————</p>




<blockquote><p>今晚，我和蕾貝佳正和家人一道用餐。這是我們正式起步的前夕：明天我們就要從加州理工學院畢業，領到那張美好的文憑了。從這所學院畢業對我們倆來說都不容易，所以這是件大事。家人圍繞在身邊也很棒。我們快樂極了。</p>

<p>蕾貝佳有隻貓叫胡迪尼。胡迪尼原本是隻流浪貓，蕾貝佳發現她，替她洗乾淨，於是一隻漂亮的挪威森林貓就出現了。胡迪尼非常聰明又很友善。她是所有我養過和看過的貓裡最棒的。她之所以被取名為「海麗葉特・胡迪尼」，是因為她像脫逃大師胡迪尼一樣擁有逃脫密室的能力。學校生活的這幾年中，蕾貝佳有個朋友住在學院附近的房子，她有時會把胡迪尼寄放在這裡。白天時，胡迪尼都被安全地鎖在一個房間裡，門窗都是關閉的，但到了下午，她就會神奇地脫逃，然後出現在屋外，在院子裡閒逛。這種事發生過好幾次。那個朋友發誓他沒有把貓放出來。這就是她名字的由來。</p>

<p>但今晚，胡迪尼待在蕾貝佳母親奇諾市的公寓裡，位於帕薩迪納東邊四十分鐘左右的距離。蕾貝佳在那套公寓裡住了大約半年，因為胡迪尼還在那，所以蕾貝佳要回去餵她。蕾貝佳大部份的衣物也都在那，所以她也要回去換衣服。於是晚餐後，我心愛的妻子蕾貝佳就往奇諾去了。一兩個鐘頭後，我接到蕾貝佳的電話。那時大概是半夜十一或十二點，我們畢業的前夕。我是個夜貓子，所以我還醒著，但我接到電話的確很驚訝。蕾貝佳說了「你可以來接我嗎？」之類的話。她可能也說了「我在醫院」，但我不確定。我在未來的人生裡就會知道真正的答案了，但我生命中這兩分鐘的悲劇性失敗是因為我說了像「妳在講什麼？」、「到妳那要一個小時耶」還有「明天就是畢業典禮了」等等的話。此刻唯一的正確答案應該是：「好的，我馬上到！」因為我沒有說出這六個簡單的字，這就成了我人生中最大的失敗。</p>

<p>蕾貝佳在奇諾公寓的車棚裡被人用尖刀襲擊了。不管那人只是要錢，還是有更糟的企圖，我們都無從得知。蕾貝佳大聲尖叫，然後不可思議地空手奪刃。刀刃的部分！幸好這英勇的舉動把兇手嚇跑了。蕾貝佳打了911，然後被警察送去醫院。</p>

<p>她是從那裡打給我的。在刀口下倖存之後。再強調一次，這是我人生最慘的失敗。這也是我當下立志絕不再犯的失敗。絕不再讓她失望。我們走過來了，第二天也正式畢業。蕾貝佳的手指包紮起來，以保護傷口和縫線。我們倆都很累，但很快樂。</p></blockquote>




<p>—————</p>




<p>從那之後我們極少分開。至今已二十五年了。</p>


<h3>Three</h3>

<p>I worked as a contractor and consultant for several years, and then stopped working shortly before my first daughter was born.  About a year and a half later, a friend and coworker asked me if I could help them out.  The company was Evant, earlier named Retail Aspect.</p>

<p>Evant was in the process of landing Staples with their product: a multidimensional retail planning application.  If you take a retailer like The Gap, they have to plan what clothes they will have in the store for each month of the year.  They can use previous years to help their predictions, but each year new styles and colors come out, so it is somewhat a magical art to get the inventories right.  Planning tools help the planners work with huge amounts of historical data, huge numbers of stores, and huge number of items.  The planners want quick responses as the transform the plans for the entire fleet of stores.  I forget what Staples store count was, but The Gap has about two thousand stores, so Staples is probably similar.  Two thousand stores, maybe a thousand products, various variations on the products, and planning at the day or week level.  For each product there could be several dozen metrics.  And we also have several years worth of historical data at the item level.  So in total the planning application has to work with billions of data points… at the least.</p>

<p>So Staples loved the Evant product.  Very leading edge UI, flexible planning engine capabilities, etc.  Looked good to go forward into actual production use.  Except for a “little problem”.  The problem was the planning product was a prototype.  And written by someone no longer with the company.  And among the things it could do, dealing with a billion points of data was not one of them.  So it was a very simple request: could I turn the prototype into the real thing.  In about three months.</p>

<h3>Coffee</h3>

<p>I did not drink coffee at all until after college.  After college, at some point Rebecca and I found a great bakery and coffee shop on the edge of what became the shopping section of Pasadena called “Old Pasadena”.  Originally this section of town was <em>very seedy</em>, and certain kinds of stores (the kind that Rebecca and I would be unlikely to frequent) actually lasted a very long time through the gentrification of the section.  The bakery was at the end, was nice and airy, and looked out over the gorge that now holds the 710.  They served coffee in bowls.  It was very good, and I might partake in a mocha once a week.</p>

<p>When Rebecca and I joined OOCL (Orient Overseas Container Lines) to work on a large Smalltalk project, I think I started drinking a bit more coffee.  May have been just a ritual, and I am not sure whether it was even a daily ritual.  I know I was a lightweight in the coffee arena.  One day I went to a new coffee shop that does two shots by default.  I was <em>wired</em> that day, and made sure to call the shots (1) in the future.</p>

<p>The Evant project changed all that.  I had been home with my wife and Maya for at least 18 months.  I mountain biked several times a week, up some serious mountains.  I had plenty of money in the bank, so I didn’t need to work at all… at least for a while longer.  I liked my life.</p>

<p>I also liked the Evant challenge laid before me.  And the Evant team already had several of my friends in it: two were at my wedding.  And the new people I met, I immediately liked them too.  I wanted <em>both lives</em>.  <em>Concurrently</em>.</p>

<p>Turns out, you can do that.  You simply multi-task at some proper unit of granularity.  I picked by the day.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I would go into Evant and work my but off.  The other four days I would keep my family life.  Maybe responding to an email or doing some work at home, but definitely not at work.  To get what needed to be done, actually done in the timeline we were talking about, was not a part-time task.  It was a normal 40+ hours a week kind of task.  So I worked 12-14 hours each day I went in.  Arrive around 7AM.  Leave at 9PM.  Rarely had lunch.  Really only consumed one kind of food.</p>

<p>There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the Evant building.</p>

<p>I am no longer a lightweight.</p>

<h3>Slums</h3>

<p>To be clear, I am not claiming that Palo Alto has parts that are like the slums of Rio De Janeiro or Kolkata.  At worse, we have (or had) a trailer park, which was probably much safer and cleaner than most of the next town over.  And we have a strange part of Palo Alto that does not go to the Palo Alto school district.  But Mountain View is a perfectly good school district, and people like Salman Khan and the Crittenden principle are making it better by the day.</p>

<p>By slums I mean a place where (a) people are living an appreciably worse standard of living then those around them, (b) those people have no economic power to make their life significantly better without “emigrating”, &copy; people’s health and happiness are meaningfully impacted, and (d) there is imminent threat of things getting much worse.</p>

<p>If my definition is so irreconcilable with yours that you must stop reading, I understand.  If you have not bought the book yet, please put it back on the shelf.  If you did, it may be a good white elephant gift.</p>

<p>If you are still here: Rebecca and I did not actually move into the slums.  They came to us…    <a href="/more">More</a></p>
